## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I delete the Administrator role?
No, the plugin protects all default WordPress roles (Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber) from deletion to prevent accidental site lockouts.

### Will deleting a role delete users assigned to that role?
No, users are never deleted. WordPress will automatically reassign users to the default Subscriber role when their role is deleted.

### Is it safe to remove orphaned capabilities?
Yes, if a plugin is no longer active, its capabilities are not needed. However, if you plan to reactivate a plugin, you may want to keep its capabilities.

### Can I undo capability changes?
The plugin doesn't have a built-in undo feature. However, you can:
1. Copy capabilities from another role to restore them
2. Manually re-add capabilities
3. Use a database backup to restore previous states

### Does this work with multisite?
The plugin works on multisite installations but operates on a per-site basis. Each site in the network has its own role management.

### Will this affect my site's performance?
No, the plugin only loads on admin pages and has minimal impact on site performance. All operations are performed only when needed.

- **Core WordPress:** Basic post, page, and media capabilities
- **Administration:** User and plugin management capabilities
- **WooCommerce:** Shop and product management capabilities

## Security & Permissions
